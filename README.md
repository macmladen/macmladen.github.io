# MacMladen Blog is based on Clean Blog by Start Bootstrap - Jekyll Version

The official Jekyll version of the Clean Blog theme by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).

## Background

It is quite easy to get lost with all the hype, expectations, options, themes, tools and everything else. Just like life is not complicated enough by itself.

While I decided on domain name (quite strangely coinciding with my nickname) in August 2014 and I was quite sure I'd go with [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

And then, I wished some new shiny things like [Octopress 2](http://octopress.org/) and looked for this and that and read *how to* and... on and on while my page stood there just an inch from *Lorem ipsum* and shallow void.


## [Jekyll themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/)

And then in my quest I decided to start with themes and I stumbled upon Jekyll themes.

**The good thing:** they are free, open, ready to fork them, learn and adjust to your own taste.

**The bad thing:** they are not for average Jane and John Do, you need to have a solid grip on Ruby and Node based development and tools, and SASS proficiency surely helps. 

## Tao

This blog will be my place to post some of my experiences as [sysadmin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_administrator/), sometimes as [DevOps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps/) but I pretty much enjoy any challenge that I face in my work every day, be it front-end or Drupal theme development, [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) or some Ruby gems issues, [Drupal](http://drupal.org//) site building, development, upgrade, maintenance or tuning, [bash](https://gist.github.com/macmladen/4224633) scripts, [jQuery](http://jquery.org/) eye-candy or exploring new territories with [Ember](http://emberjs.com/)
